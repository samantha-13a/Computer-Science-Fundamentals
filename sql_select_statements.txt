3. Given this dogs table, write queries to select the following pieces of data:

CREATE TABLE dogs (
  "id"          INTEGER, 
  "name"        VARCHAR(25),
  "gender"      VARCHAR(1),
  "age"         INTEGER,
  "weight"      INTEGER,
  "breed"       TEXT,
  "intake_date" DATE,
  "in_foster"   DATE
);

INSERT INTO dogs
  ("id",  "name",      "gender", "age", "weight", "breed",              "intake_date", "in_foster")
VALUES
  (10001, 'Boujee',    'F',       3,     36,      'labrador poodle',    '2017-06-22',   null),
  (10002, 'Munchkin',  'F',       0,     8,       'dachsund chihuahua', '2017-01-13',  '2017-01-31'),
  (10004, 'Marley',    'M',       0,     10,      'labrador',           '2017-05-04',  '2016-06-20'),
  (10003, 'Lassie',    'F',       7,     17,      'collie shepherd',    '2016-07-05',  '2017-07-22'),
  (10006, 'Marmaduke', 'M',       7,     150,     'great dane',         '2016-03-22',  '2016-05-15'),
  (10007, 'Rosco',     'M',       5,     180,     'rottweiler',         '2017-04-01',   null);
---
Intake teams typically guess the breed of shelter dogs, so the breed column may have multiple words (for example, "Labrador Collie mix").
---

- Display the name, gender, and age of all dogs that are part Labrador.
SELECT name, gender, age
FROM dogs
WHERE breed LIKE '%Labrador%'

- Display the ids of all dogs that are under 1 year old.
SELECT id
FROM dogs 
WHERE age < 1

- Display the name and age of all dogs that are female and over 35lbs.
SELECT name, age
FROM dogs
WHERE gender = F
AND age > 35

- Display all of the information about all dogs that are not Shepherd mixes.
SELECT *
FROM dogs
WHERE breed NOT LIKE '%Shepherd%'

- Display the id, age, weight, and breed of all dogs that are either over 60lbs or Great Danes.
SELECT  id, age, weight, breed
FROM dogs
WHERE weight > 60
OR breed = 'Great Dane'



4. Given this cats table, what records are returned from these queries?

CREATE TABLE cats(
  "id"            INTEGER,
  "name"          VARCHAR(16),
  "gender"        VARCHAR(1),
  "age"           INTEGER,
  "intake_date"   DATE,
  "adoption_date" DATE
);
    
INSERT INTO cats
    ("id", "name",   "gender", "age", "intake_date", "adoption_date")
VALUES
    ( 1, 'Mushi',    'M',       1,    '2016-01-09',  '2016-03-22'),
    ( 2, 'Seashell', 'F',       7,    '2016-01-09',   NULL),
    ( 3, 'Azul',     'M',       3,    '2016-01-11',  '2016-04-17'),
    ( 4, 'Victoire', 'M',       7,    '2016-01-11',  '2016-09-01'),
    ( 5, 'Nala',     'F',       1,    '2016-01-12',   NULL);


- SELECT name, adoption_date FROM cats;
Mushi     | 2016-03-22
Seashell  | NULL
Azul      | 2016-04-17
Victoire  | 2016-09-01
Nala      | NULL

- SELECT name, age FROM cats;
Mushi    | 1
Seashell | 7
Azul     | 3
Victoire | 7
Nala     | 1



5. From the cats table, write queries to select the following pieces of data.

- Display all the information about all of the available cats.
SELECT *
FROM cats
WHERE adoption_date = NULL 

- Display the name and sex of all cats who are 7 years old.
SELECT name, sex 
FROM cats 
WHERE age = 7

- Find all of the names of the cats, so you don’t choose duplicate names for new cats.
SELECT name 
FROM cats 



6. List each comparison operator and explain when you would use it. Include a real world example for each.

= Equal to 
Example: Finding info on when an account last logged in on a table of user information where the user id is equal to a certain number.  

> Greater than
Example: Finding names from a table of students going on a student trip whose year of birth is greater than 2000. 

< Less than
Example: Finding names on a table of campers where the camper's age is less than 13.

>= Greater than or equal to
Example: Finding the ids from a table of students where the student's SAT scores were greater than or equal to 2000.

<= Less than or equal to 
Example: Finding an item from a table of store stock where the current stock is less than or equal to 3. 

<> Not equal to (also !=)
Example: Finding the names from a table of different vertebrates where the type is not equal to mammal. 



7. From the cats table, what data is returned from these queries?

- SELECT name FROM cats WHERE gender = ‘F’;
Seashell 
Nala 

- SELECT name FROM cats WHERE age <> 3;
Mushi 
Seashell 
Victoire 
Nala 

- SELECT ID FROM cats WHERE name != ‘Mushi’ AND gender = ‘M’;
